# Two Papers

- (*)African soil properties and nutrients mapped at 30 m spatial resolution using two‐scale ensemble machine learning

- Earth Observation Data-Driven Cropland Soil Monitoring: A Review

---

#### Two‐scale ensemble machine learning
- Principle: Using two set of Fine-grained and Coarse-grained Level to build the model.
- Fomula

$y(\phi, \theta, d) = d + x_1(\phi, \theta) + x_2(\phi, \theta) + \cdots + x_p(\phi, \theta)$
- Meanings


    - $\phi$
    - $\theta$
    - $d$
    - $x_p(\phi, \theta)$

### Earth Observation Data-Driven Cropland Soil Monitoring: A Review

- A review of Earth Observation.

- After an overview of this paper, I judge that this paper is not too useful for my practical work, but...

# More reseaches from China

1. [**"Machine learning and soil sciences: a review aided by machine learning tools"**](https://soil.copernicus.org/articles/6/35/2020/)[1](https://soil.copernicus.org/articles/6/35/2020/): (Recommended)

- A review article
- 12 Main topics in this reigions

2.  [**China Soil Database - a national soil data set based on the second soil census**](http://soildata.issas.ac.cn/Uploads/file/20211207/18210d28310c0fca3f49721d160b9437.pdf)(Chinese version)

==As the country with the most in-depth research and greatest contributions to agriculture, China has a detailed database, which is the result of a professional and authoritative investigation team. Although this does not directly help us use Google Earth for machine learning, it has some inspiration for our next research. Some countries and regions may have similar surveys, and if we can take advantage of these studies, for example, using this kind of exhaustive survey as a good test set to train our model built by data from Google Earth, we can increase the robustness of the model. ==

# Machine learning and soil sciences: a review aided by machine learning tools



- Which ML methods are commonly used and how often have they been used?  
- In which areas of soil sciences do we use ML, and how are they clustered and related?  
- Do advanced ML methods perform significantly better than linear or non-linear statistical approaches?  
- Can ML methods simulate soil processes in space and time?
- Can we use ML methods to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil?
